1.How do I approach designing software?


What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

More familiarity with using c++ and opengl. I dont anticipate doing graphical design using this system in the future though. I do a fair amount of game design with unity and blender and feel more comfortable rapidly completeing large projects compared to this.

What design process did you follow for your project work?

I like to adhere strictly to rubrics or guidelines when completing projects for work or school. Its important to set those guide rails so that the finished project is in spec of what was requested.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

I would say that this method of problem solving is something I have done previously, and will continue to do in the future.


2.How do I approach developing programs?


What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

Visual feedback was perhaps the most important strategy developing these projects. I generally always had a rough idea of what the system would look like before I ran it, but to make tweeks or revisions I had to rely on what I personally thought looked best in terms of realism.

How did iteration factor into your development?

Heavily, for the above mentioned reason. Shapes and sizes were generally rough approximations of what I desired so I would have to constantly tweak things and rerun the program to get the desired result.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

I dont believe my approach changed through the milestones. A fair amount of my effort was trial and error, but new concepts were being rolled out weekly so I would follow the same strategy to adapt.


3.How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?


How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

Spending more time coding, understanding, and helping design any type of software project is valuable for me at this stage in my career.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

I think its unlikely, unless I manage to make a game on unity that sells more then 3 copies :D
